        <p>I'm from Chennai in India. Chennai is also known as Detroit of India because of the huge presence of the automobile industry. I moved to Chicago because I got admitted into grad school. I've been in Chicago for almost 2 years. My hobbies are going for long walks, playing guitar, and listening to music.</p>
